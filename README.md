# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.

Using Python libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the notebook analyzes patterns, relationships, and correlations between different passenger attributes and survival outcomes.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses:

* `train.csv` – Training dataset (includes survival information)
* `test.csv` – Test dataset (used for future prediction tasks)

Main features in the dataset:

* `Survived` – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Pclass` – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* `Sex` – Gender
* `Age` – Age of passenger
* `SibSp` – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch` – Number of parents/children aboard
* `Fare` – Ticket fare
* `Embarked` – Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)

---

## ⚙️ Libraries Used

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

Additional configurations:

* Warnings ignored
* Seaborn styling applied
* Inline plotting enabled

## 🔎 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Dataset Overview

* Shape of training and test datasets
* First 5 rows preview

---

### 2️⃣ Survival Distribution

* Count of survived vs not survived
* Overall survival rate
* Bar chart visualization

---

### 3️⃣ Survival by Passenger Class

* Count per class
* Survival rate per class
* Comparison visualization

**Insight:** Higher class passengers had better survival rates.

---

### 4️⃣ Survival by Gender

* Survival count by gender
* Survival rate comparison

**Insight:** Females had significantly higher survival rates than males.

---

### 5️⃣ Age Analysis

* Age statistics summary
* Age distribution by survival
* Histogram comparison

**Insight:** Younger passengers had relatively better survival chances.

---

### 6️⃣ Fare Analysis

* Fare statistics summary
* Fare distribution by survival

**Insight:** Higher ticket fare (often higher class) correlates with higher survival probability.

---

### 7️⃣ Family Size Analysis

* Created new feature:

  ```python
  FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1
  ```
* Survival rate by family size

**Insight:** Small families had better survival rates compared to passengers traveling alone or in large groups.

---

### 8️⃣ Embarked Port Analysis

* Passenger count by port
* Survival rate by port

---

### 9️⃣ Correlation Analysis

* Encoded categorical variables:

  * Sex → numeric
  * Embarked → numeric
* Generated correlation matrix
* Heatmap visualization

**Key Correlations with Survival:**

* Strong positive: Sex (female)
* Negative: Pclass (lower class → lower survival)
* Moderate: Fare

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

* Bar Charts
* Histograms
* Grouped Comparisons
* Correlation Heatmap

All visualizations use:

* Seaborn styling
* Clean grid-based formatting
* Clear labeling and titles

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

✔ Females had much higher survival rates
✔ 1st class passengers survived more
✔ Higher fare correlates with survival
✔ Smaller families had better survival chances
✔ Passenger class strongly influenced survival

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook task3.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Handle missing values (Age, Embarked)
* Feature engineering
* Build predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
